# Crack Detection in Concrete using CNN Model
Simple AI model created to detect crack in an input concrete image

## Why do we require this ? 
Manually inspecting cracks on concrete surface is solely dependent on the inspector's skills and talents. To automate this and produce normalized results, the usage of a basic vision based method using a deep architecture of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for automated crack detection could be really useful in this field.
